## Synopsis

Pomodoro Clock is a time management tool. It breaks down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, seperated by short breaks. Those intervals are named [pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

Users can reset and customize the length of each pomodoro. Start a pomodoro, and the timer will go off once the setting minutes has elapsed.

Coded in native Javascript.
